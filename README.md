## Project Description

This project implements a modular state estimation and mapping system for a mobile robot using a Raspberry Pi-based platform. The robot integrates odometry, IMU data, and LiDAR to build a global map of its environment while tracking its own pose. Core functionality includes real-time data fusion with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), scan matching via the Open3D libraryâ€™s ICP algorithm, and autonomous exploration using frontier detection and path planning. The system is designed for periodic corrections, where the robot stops to collect high-quality LiDAR scans that are aligned to a global map for improved localization.

## Repository Structure

All currently relevant code is located in the `main` branch.

- **`filter/`**: Contains the core filtering and motion control logic.
  - Use `main.py` in this directory to operate the robot. This script handles movement and filtering.
- **`tests/`**: Includes scripts for individual operations:
  - Taking a LiDAR scan and saving it as a CSV
  - Matching scans using the Open3D ICP library
  - Building a global map
  - Detecting frontiers
  - Generating a path to the next exploration point
